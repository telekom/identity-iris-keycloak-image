# Iris Keycloak Image (IKI)

## About

This project is used for setUp docker image, which will be used as a preconfigured Keycloak to run it as the
identity provider with custom extensions. This _IKI_ comes with selected
[extensions](https://www.keycloak.org/extensions.html) (here with a prometheus metrics exporter).

## Original Keycloak Image

Use original Keycloak image from quay.io/keycloak/ or mirror it if needed
to your specific repository and provide its destination inside the Dockerfile. In this version the Keycloak image with
tag **26.0.8** is used.

## Chart

It's intended to be used with the Helm chart provided in the [gitHub repo](https://github.com/telekom/iris-charts)

## Extensions

### keycloak-metrics-spi

There are the metrics extension used [keycloak-metrics-spi](https://github.com/aerogear/keycloak-metrics-spi).
The extension has not been modified and is used as is.

When you deploy Keycloak using this image, a new REST endpoint is made
available: `https://my-keycloak-instance/auth/realms/master/metrics`.  
From this endpoint you will be able to access all metrics from all(!) realms no matter what realm is in the URL.

(!) This path is not password-protected. To prevent unauthorized access to the metrics the chart blocks the path by
using ha-proxy

To provide the metrics to the monitoring infrastructure HAProxy forwards requests from :9542/metrics to Keycloak
metrics. You can see how [HAProxy](https://github.com/telekom/iris-charts) configured
under _templates/configmap-haproxy.yaml_ directory.

## Local development

### Run Keycloak

To run an on-the-fly development Keycloak on your local machine, follow these
steps: [original documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-zip)

1. Download Keycloak server binaries here: https://www.keycloak.org/downloads
2. Unzip to desired location
3. Run development mode with `kc.sh start-dev` or `kc.bat start-dev`
4. Set up a realm. You may also add an identity provider redirecting to the master
   realm.

## Reset local settings

Delete the `h2` directory in your `keycloak/data` directory.

### Local Build

You can build the Keycloak image locally using a **multi-stage Docker build**, which compiles custom extensions and
packages them into the final image â€” no manual steps required.

This build process includes:

- Building all custom **Keycloak extensions**, such as `keycloak-metrics-spi` and `client-auth-method-spi`
- Packaging the compiled extensions directly into the final Keycloak image

To run the build:

```bash
docker build -t iris .
```

By default, the image uses the Keycloak version specified in the Dockerfile (`BASE_IMAGE_TAG`). If you want to override
it:

```bash
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_TAG=24.0.2 -t iris .
```

ðŸ’¡ On non-amd64 machines, you may need to add `--platform=linux/amd64`. On most systems, itâ€™s safe to omit it.
